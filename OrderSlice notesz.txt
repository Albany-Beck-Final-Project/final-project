Order Slicing 

-> If the order is above a certain size then it should make multiple smaller ones. 


When a user executes a buy or sell order call the sort order to filter through the buy order to see if theres a 
match in a sell order. This is ordered by date. 

Best match input price per share 

Best match Buy order with the lowest sell.

When creating Orders:
-> Make a switch case to apply the different type of orders
-> Include the different type of orders and research to know which one has what?

Different types: 

-> Market Order ( no price limit) 

-> Limit Order (price limit) 

-> Hidden Limit (price limit is hidden)
